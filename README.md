This code completes the weekly challenge for Module #2 in Columbia's Coding Bootcamp.
<br/>

I have created a work sample portfolio, which contains:
- My name
- A recent photo
- A short bio
- Links for sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
    - Clicking a given link scrolls the page to the given section
- A collection of clickable, titled images of sample web applications of mine
    - These are currently dummy/filler projects; clicking on a given project takes the user to a dummy page
        - I will update these with real projects as I build more
    - Project #1's image is larger than that of the others
        - For practical/visual reasons, this is true only for tablet-sized screens and larger; for screens narrower than 768px, all project images are the same size

The web application uses a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports and devices.

Below are screenshots of the final version of the web application at various screen sizes:
