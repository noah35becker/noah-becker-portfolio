This code completes the weekly challenge for Module #2 in Columbia's Coding Bootcamp.
<br/>

I have created a work sample portfolio, which contains:
- My name
- Navigation links for page sections
    - Clicking a given nav link scrolls the page to the given section
- A recent photo
- A short bio
- A sample collection of clickable, titled images of web applications of mine
    - These are currently dummy/filler projects; clicking on a given project takes the user to a dummy page
        - I will update these with real projects as I actually build more
    - Project #1's image is larger than that of the other projects
        - For practical/visual reasons, this is true only for tablet-sized screens and larger; for screens narrower than 768px, all project images are the same size
- Clickable contact info

The web application uses a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports and devices.

Below are screenshots (best viewed if downloaded locally) of the final version of this web application at various screen sizes:
